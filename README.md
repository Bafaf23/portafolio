## Notes from the developer
El siguiente es un trabajo realizado con magia antigua, con hechizos que ni el mismo hechizero supremo si atreve a conjurar. Powered by the soul of Tailwind for a clean and uncluttered interface. 

The last developer who joined never left, and those who think about joining end up going crazy without even opening a folder.

Good luck on this trip to the jungle.
